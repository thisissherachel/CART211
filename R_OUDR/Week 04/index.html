                When watching this video, I was quite surprised by the different type of advances that were brought out to the public at the same time. The mouse and keyboard seem reasonable for the late 1960s but when I saw the collaborative working space and the video conferencing, I was quite surprised. I only started collaborative work, or at last found out it existed through google pages, about 10 years ago. It was fun to see Engelbart explain all the concepts to a public that must be so excited by these new developments. It allowed me to live through them a little and share that excitement.

                Seeing and the evolution of the internet's use going from military to academia to public along with the evolution of the network centralization, decentralization, and privatization was very interesting. Especially when we see today what itâ€™s become. But thinking about something mentioned, which was that the internet was the greatest invention since electricity, it got me thinking about something I also saw which how impactful glass was in history. It raises the question of the limits of internet without glass (i.e a computer screen). That said, one could say how the internet raised the importance of a screen and pushed its development.

                It was beautiful to see the article dissect the complex shift between the computer as a bureaucratic counting machine to a communal intelligence machine. Talking about the contributions of Stuart Brand with his counterculture bible the <i>Whole Earth Catalog</i>, it was very interesting to see how this communal information concept was able to inspire so many engineers in different ways and for different reasons but still have the same conclusion: computers have communal intelligence potential. That said, it is funny to read this article preaching about machine and their ability for communal intelligence and hence collective growth but then see today how everything evolved. The communal access to information today seems to drive away from the idea of collective growth and more into the idea of individualism and the increase in extremism. Rather using the information to grow as a collective, it is used to differentiate one another.
