            When watching this video, I was quite surprised by the different type of advances that were brought out to the public at the same time. The mouse and keyboard seem reasonable for the late 1960s but when I saw the collaborative working
            space and the video conferencing, I was quite surprised. I only started collaborative work, or at last found out it existed through google pages, about 10 years ago. It was fun to see Engelbart explain all the concepts to a public that
            must be so excited by these new developments. It allowed me to live through them a little and share that excitement.

            Seeing and the evolution of the internet's use going from military to academia to public along with the evolution of the network centralization, decentralization, and privatization was very interesting. Especially when we see today what
            it’s become. But thinking about something mentioned, which was that the internet was the greatest invention since electricity, it got me thinking about something I also saw which how impactful glass was in history. It raises the question
            of the limits of internet without glass (i.e a computer screen). That said, one could say how the internet raised the importance of a screen and pushed its development.

            It was beautiful to see the article dissect the complex shift between the computer as a bureaucratic counting machine to a communal intelligence machine. Talking about the contributions of Stuart Brand with his counterculture bible the
            <i>Whole Earth Catalog</i>, it was very interesting to see how this communal information concept was able to inspire so many engineers in different ways and for different reasons but still have the same conclusion: computers have communal
            intelligence potential. That said, it is funny to read this article preaching about machine and their ability for communal intelligence and hence collective growth but then see today how everything evolved. The communal access to
            information today seems to drive away from the idea of collective growth and more into the idea of individualism and the increase in extremism. Rather using the information to grow as a collective, it is used to differentiate one another.

          </button>
          <p>
            Reading the history of how art implicated itself in the newly immergence of the internet seemed inevitable however, the discussion on how the internet impacted the art community was really something to appreciate. Greene speaks about how
            the internet began to empower artists through its ability to facilitate communication and community which in return allowed much more visibility to artists. The exposure, inspiration, and breaking of boundaries was like never seem before.
            It’s never something I thought about but the immergence of Net.art was absolutely revolutionary for artists. It’s easy to take advantage of the amount of access and how large of a following or platform one can have with the use of the
            internet today. This aspect of the internet really is a beautiful benefit of its creation.

            In this piece there was a lot of great ‘<i>one-liners</i>’. Here I’ll share a few that struck a cord in me and hopefully you can also take a little something from them even if they’re taken out of context: “<i>everything is anything
            else</i>”, “<i>in a cultural climate where we have accepted that the singular qualification for the moniker “art” is the intention of any one individual to label it as such.</i>”, “<i>insist on a participatory view of a culture at
            large, and ultimately of taking iconoclasm itself as a quotidian activity</i>”, “<i>Ironically, the most radical and “progressive” movements of the Post-Internet period would be those who either pass by either largely unnoticed due to a
            decision to opt out of any easily-accessible distribution networks, or else would be composed of a community of people producing cultural objects not intended as artistic propositions and not applying themselves with the label of
            artist.</i>”, “<i>extraordinary is now also the ordinary—the myth is also the everyday</i>”, “<i>Dealing with language can too forcibly illustrate the thoughts behind an image, or belittle a work if the text is not as clever or
            aesthetic as the image itself</i>”, and lastly “<i>move seamlessly from physical representation to Internet representation, either changing for each context, built with an intention of universality, or created with a deliberate
            irreverence for either venue of transmission</i>”. I pulled all these because as an artist myself (very not post-internet of me to say), these made me really question my practice in today’s era, culture, and my placement in society in
            regards to everything.

            This article brought up a lot of issues with crypto that I was unaware of but also dived into really the pros and cons of it all. It talked about the environmental impact of NFTs, how NFTs opened doors for many digital artists, the recent art movement of crypto art that is evolving from it all, the political divergence of crypto’s original socialist intent, the inequality that still is very present even in the digital and physical art world, and generally what blockchains are, why they are being used, different ways they could be used, and the reality of them today post pandemic. All of this is definitely overwhelming. A part of me wants to participate as an artist, a part of me wants to boycott or find better eco-conscious ways, and another part of me just wants us to get to green energy already so we can all chill a little. This article did not help with my capitalist, patriarchal, and climate crisis dread.
