              When watching this video, I was quite surprised by the different type of advances that were brought out to the public at the same time. The mouse and keyboard seem reasonable for the late 1960s but when I saw the collaborative working
              space and the video conferencing, I was quite surprised. I only started collaborative work, or at last found out it existed through google pages, about 10 years ago. It was fun to see Engelbart explain all the concepts to a public that
              must be so excited by these new developments. It allowed me to live through them a little and share that excitement.

              Seeing and the evolution of the internet's use going from military to academia to public along with the evolution of the network centralization, decentralization, and privatization was very interesting. Especially when we see today what
              it’s become. But thinking about something mentioned, which was that the internet was the greatest invention since electricity, it got me thinking about something I also saw which how impactful glass was in history. It raises the
              question
              of the limits of internet without glass (i.e a computer screen). That said, one could say how the internet raised the importance of a screen and pushed its development.

            <p>
              It was beautiful to see the article dissect the complex shift between the computer as a bureaucratic counting machine to a communal intelligence machine. Talking about the contributions of Stuart Brand with his counterculture bible the
              <i>Whole Earth Catalog</i>, it was very interesting to see how this communal information concept was able to inspire so many engineers in different ways and for different reasons but still have the same conclusion: computers have
              communal
              intelligence potential. That said, it is funny to read this article preaching about machine and their ability for communal intelligence and hence collective growth but then see today how everything evolved. The communal access to
              information today seems to drive away from the idea of collective growth and more into the idea of individualism and the increase in extremism. Rather using the information to grow as a collective, it is used to differentiate one
              another.

            </button>
            <p>
              Reading the history of how art implicated itself in the newly immergence of the internet seemed inevitable however, the discussion on how the internet impacted the art community was really something to appreciate. Greene speaks about
              how
              the internet began to empower artists through its ability to facilitate communication and community which in return allowed much more visibility to artists. The exposure, inspiration, and breaking of boundaries was like never seem
              before.
              It’s never something I thought about but the immergence of Net.art was absolutely revolutionary for artists. It’s easy to take advantage of the amount of access and how large of a following or platform one can have with the use of the
              internet today. This aspect of the internet really is a beautiful benefit of its creation.

              In this piece there was a lot of great ‘<i>one-liners</i>’. Here I’ll share a few that struck a cord in me and hopefully you can also take a little something from them even if they’re taken out of context: “<i>everything is anything
                else</i>”, “<i>in a cultural climate where we have accepted that the singular qualification for the moniker “art” is the intention of any one individual to label it as such.</i>”, “<i>insist on a participatory view of a culture at
                large, and ultimately of taking iconoclasm itself as a quotidian activity</i>”, “<i>Ironically, the most radical and “progressive” movements of the Post-Internet period would be those who either pass by either largely unnoticed due to
                a
                decision to opt out of any easily-accessible distribution networks, or else would be composed of a community of people producing cultural objects not intended as artistic propositions and not applying themselves with the label of
                artist.</i>”, “<i>extraordinary is now also the ordinary—the myth is also the everyday</i>”, “<i>Dealing with language can too forcibly illustrate the thoughts behind an image, or belittle a work if the text is not as clever or
                aesthetic as the image itself</i>”, and lastly “<i>move seamlessly from physical representation to Internet representation, either changing for each context, built with an intention of universality, or created with a deliberate
                irreverence for either venue of transmission</i>”. I pulled all these because as an artist myself (very not post-internet of me to say), these made me really question my practice in today’s era, culture, and my placement in society in
              regards to everything.

            </button>
            <p>
              This article brought up a lot of issues with crypto that I was unaware of but also dived into really the pros and cons of it all. It talked about the environmental impact of NFTs, how NFTs opened doors for many digital artists, the
              recent art movement of crypto art that is evolving from it all, the political divergence of crypto’s original socialist intent, the inequality that still is very present even in the digital and physical art world, and generally what
              blockchains are, why they are being used, different ways they could be used, and the reality of them today post pandemic. All of this is definitely overwhelming. A part of me wants to participate as an artist, a part of me wants to
              boycott or find better eco-conscious ways, and another part of me just wants us to get to green energy already so we can all chill a little. This article did not help with my capitalist, patriarchal, and climate crisis dread.

            </button>
            <p>
              Reading Lessig’s “Free Culture” really just reminds me how much of a capitalist society we all live in. This question of ownership is very much linked to the way our society is built, or at least how it evolved and that is in the
              direction of late-stage capitalism. Growing up in this society, it’s hard to image one without ownership. Ownership is in almost all aspects of our lives, even relationships. However, this idea of normalizing the giving of credit but
              allowing the right to build upon seems very much like my socialist society dream.

            </button>
            <p>
              Similar to the last text, this is again just a fight against late-stage capitalism. A fight against this idea of ownership because we all know this concept was just created to maximize profit for the 1%. There’s always been this false
              claim against socialist ideals that without the capitalist monetary push there would be no source of motivation. This is false and there are multiple sources to prove it. Especially with such an interactive field as programming.
              Positive reinforcement, contributing to society, personal interest, and a passion for the field is enough. Programming is a field that is already very much based in the sharing of resources and sharing of work through this idea of
              “programming is just a bunch “copy-pasting”” so I believe that it should remain that way and if not, be reinforced through all software.

              There were two things that stood out to me in this piece: the confirmation that yet another field was impacted by a patriarchal and socially insensitive system and the idea of software and transparency. These two things were those I’ve
              read about or pondered a little before but seeing it in a different light is always nice. I read another piece recently titled “The Intersection between Culture, Gender, and Technology” by Patrick D. Hopkins which wasn’t as intense as
              this one where the term “slave” was thrown around for women computing but it exposed the evolution of such a state related to tech. How software or hardware built in this state can affect or hinder future generations. Subsequently, the
              idea of software and transparency…I’ve always just had a deep sense that software was the epidemy of transparency. Nothing can be created nor destroyed but especially in tech because all your interactions with the computer are recorded
              to be computed…That said, it’s still unclear to me where deleted folders go…

            </button>
            <p>
              I personally did not enjoy reading this piece by Sherry Turkle. I understand this was written in the late 1900’s where generalizing and stereotyping was more common however, I disliked how large her claims were regarding those
              generalizations she made. It was written in a subjective tone and she went about writing the piece in a seemingly storytelling way of how abnormal and so called “ugly” individuals are unfit for society. Yes, she makes her claims with
              elements taken from hacker culture at the time like the idea of self-proclaimed “lusers” however, rather than giving a tone that this abnormality is unfit for society and in turn machines are toxic to the human race, I would have rather
              seen more of a positive twist to it. That said, I believe today’s reality is a positive twist to it. Computer engineers work hard at what they do, and some might be neurodivergent, but I would disagree that this directly leads to
              “ugliness”, “unfit” and “socially inept”. And even if those are the case, this does not mean that they are less than. Someone not fitting in the ideal human form spread by media, good looking and socially charming, does not make them
              less than.

            </button>
            <p>
              When thinking about the concept of “the cloud”, it reminds me of this idea that humanity has a lot of difficulty conceptualizing the unknown. As much as the unknown allows us to move forward and motivate us in discovery and advancements in technology, it also leads us into realms of delusion. Like the article mentioned, this concept of the cloud makes us believe it is always there however, it is very much attached to physical spaces that can be affected by the electromagnetic power of sandstorms for example. This exploration of “the cloud” and the origin of it’s concept did expose me to how American centric it is. Thus, popping that bubble of the “world wide web” and more like the “euro colonized web”. Americanization, big topic…

            <p>
              I very much enjoyed reading about the history of programming and more of an alternative view of it all throughout history and I believe the readings did a great job at doing that. I especially enjoyed seeing how the art world evolved throughout history in relation to the evolution of technology throughout time. The recent articles about crypto art, post-internet art, and net-art were all new concepts for that I very much enjoyed finding out about. It’s not always easy for me to find motivation to do class readings but once I found out I was actually interested in the things in the texts it became much easier. I learnt a lot through these readings and it was refreshing.
