        <h3>
          Vierkant continues to explain this as an object not being limited to a fixed state or
          simply one version of itself. Meaning that one art object can be manipulated,
          recontextualized, or recreated by the same or another artist and hold the same level of
          recognition for its conceptual thinking. An art object can also just be shown,
          represented, described, or morphed in various ways while keeping the same meaning or
          essence. Especially online and in this “post-Internet climate” as they’d say. This being
          very much tied to Conceptual Art and representational strategy, it is expressed that this
          form of exploring an art object has indeed existed pre-internet however, the Post-Internet
          period has served as a catalyst for these concepts in extreme ways.
        </h3>
        <!-- our take/understanding of it -->
        <p>
          Something close to the concept around this quote is René Magritte’s famous piece called
          The Treachery of Images where the words “ceci n’est pas une pipe” are displayed under the
          image of a pipe. This expressing the idea that something isn’t something if it is only the
          image of something. In this Post-Internet period, that concept is almost eradicated. We
          seem to be in this in between state of the physical and the non-physical. So much art is
          online and can’t always be necessarily represented in it’s physical form and, if it was,
          it would almost be an entirely different piece within itself. The non-physical state for
          art objects is so vast, and increasing everyday with its contents, reiterations, and
          possibilities that the boundaries of what is what and what takes ore of a form, value, or
          weight over another.
