          Vierkant mentions this in relation to the idea that today, mythology is everywhere and has
          become part of our everyday life. We see mythology with superheroes in films and books.
          They have become part of our everyday life and they are easily accessible. Anyone can find
          images of films on the Internet or know of a story without seeing the movie or reading the
