          “Ironically, the most radical and ‘progressive’ movements of the Post-Internet period
          would be those who either pass by either largely unnoticed” due to a decision to opt out
          of any easily-accessible distribution networks, or else would be composed of a community
          of people producing cultural objects not intended as artistic propositions and not
          applying themselves with the label of artist.”

        <!-- explanation in the context of the text -->
        <h3>
          Not only does the Post-Internet period allow for this lack of boundaries with what is of
          value and what is not through the lost idea of a source copy and loose regulation on
          copies themselves, these questions of “what is art” and “what it means to be an artist”
          has also loosened up. Vierkant expresses a little earlier in the text that
          <hr>
          <i>“we have accepted that the singular qualification for the moniker ‘art’ is the
            intention of any one individual to label it as such.”</i>
          <hr>
          What the text explains with the quote is that the Internet, “the screen,” the digital
          world has become an integral part of our lives. It is no longer a place that separates
          people, but, on the contrary, a “communal space” as said in the text. Through the
          Internet, it becomes easy to spread one’s art, and therefore, the text argues that “the
          most radical and ‘progressive’ movements of the Post-Internet period” are people who don’t
          identify as artists while creating “cultural objects,” or people who are not using
          “easily-accessible distribution networks” and are therefore “largely unnoticed.”
        </h3>
        <!-- our take/understanding of it -->
        <p>
          In this discussion about debatably unanswerable questions of “what is art” and “who is an
          artist” and “what it means to be an artist” allows for an interesting reflection on their
          evolution through time. Vierkant makes a very interesting comment that adds to what the
          answers to those questions might mean today in this Post-Internet period. Technology
          evolves so fast around us we sometimes forget to question how those rapid changes affect
          us. Our society seems very outdated at time regarding where we our with technology. That
          said, relating back to artists today, what Vierkant comments on allows us to see that we
          are living the direct opposite of what artists 1000 years or more were but for some
          reason, it doesn’t feel all too different. It almost reminds me of inflation.
