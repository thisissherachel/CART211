                In the context of the text, and in the context of the Internet,
                an “original copy” doesn’t mean much. If it even exists. The
                Internet spreads information quicky and widely. People being
                exposed to some much don’t always have access or care to find
                out where the source of an online object is, if it has an
                original copy, or its date of creation. This facilitates ideas
                being repurposed, recreated, or identical copies being created
                with little detection and no credit to the inspiration or source
                to the original. When the text argues that the “source object
                can no longer be regarded as inherently greater than any of its
                copies” it continues to say that yes on the internet we know a
                source object exists, a source idea exists, but its necessity
                and importance have very little connection to the copy. Another
                argument is that even if the original is found, if the “copies”
                are made using a different method or medium, how can they be
                compared? The example of the text is creating a sculpture by
                using a video as the original. Even if the theme and story of
                the video is conveyed in the sculpture, they will still be
                different, and neither can be “inherently greater” than the
                other.

              <p>
                In terms of artistic value, I agree with the text, neither is
                greater because of their status as a “source object” or a
                “copy.” I believe that this is determined by the work itself and
                its execution. Just because it was the original does not mean
                that it is necessarily good and same goes for a copy. However, I
                disagree with the idea that the original is not greater than its
                copies on another level. The copies use the “source object” as
                inspiration and/or a reference; therefore, the copy takes ideas
                from somewhere else, and these ideas are important. That is why
                I think that, although it is true that original cannot be
                considered better or worse than copies from the get-go, it is
                still important to acknowledge when a work is original and when
                a work uses something else as a reference.

                What the text explains is that the Internet, “the screen,” the

                longer a place that separates people, but, on the contrary, a
                “communal space” as said in the text. Through the Internet, it
                becomes easy to spread one’s art, and therefore, the text argues
                that “the most radical and ‘progressive’ movements of the
                Post-Internet period” are people who don’t identify as artists
                while creating “cultural objects,” or people who are not using

                Using language to explain a visual artwork can be complicated

                format is important in order to present the artwork in a still
                interesting and relevant way.
