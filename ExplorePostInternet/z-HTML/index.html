              In the context of the text, and in the context of the Internet, an “original copy”
              doesn’t mean much. If it even exists. The Internet spreads information quicky and
              widely. People being exposed to some much don’t always have access or
              care to find out where the source of an online object is, if it has an original copy,
              or its date of creation. This facilitates ideas being repurposed, recreated, or
              identical copies being created with little detection and no credit to
              the inspiration or source to the original. When the text argues that the “source
              object can no longer be regarded as inherently greater than any of its copies” it
              continues to say that yes on the internet we know a source object exists,
              a source idea exists, but its necessity and importance have very little connection to
              the copy.

              Another argument is that even if the original is found, if the “copies” are made using
              a different method or medium, how can they be compared? The example of the text is
              creating a sculpture by using a video as the original. Even if the
              theme and story of the video is conveyed in the sculpture, they will still be
              different, and neither can be “inherently greater” than the other.
            </h3>
            <p>
              In terms of artistic value, I agree with the text, neither is greater because of their
              status as a “source object” or a “copy.” I believe that this is determined by the work
              itself and its execution. Just because it was the original
              does not mean that it is necessarily good and same goes for a copy. However, I
              disagree with the idea that the original is not greater than its copies on another
              level. The copies use the “source object” as inspiration and/or a
              reference; therefore, the copy takes ideas from somewhere else, and these ideas are
              important. That is why I think that, although it is true that original cannot be
              considered better or worse than copies from the get-go, it is still
              important to acknowledge when a work is original and when a work uses something else
              as a reference.

              What the text explains is that the Internet, “the screen,” the digital world has
              become an integral part of our lives. It is no longer a place that separates people,
              but, on the contrary, a “communal space” as said in the text. Through the Internet, it
              becomes easy to spread one’s art, and therefore, the text argues that “the most
              radical and ‘progressive’ movements of the Post-Internet period” are people who don’t
              identify as artists while creating “cultural objects,” or people who are not using
              “easily-accessible distribution networks” and are therefore “largely unnoticed.”

              Using language to explain a visual artwork can be complicated and sometimes
              inadequate. “Dealing with language can too forcibly illustrate the thoughts behind an
              image or belittle a work if the text is not as clever or aesthetic as the image
              itself.” Therefore, how a physical visual work like a painting or a sculpture (or
              anything analog) is transposed to a digital format is important in order to present
              the artwork in a still interesting and relevant way.
