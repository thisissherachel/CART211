                The meaning of this quote in The Image Object Post-Internet is
                described as an object not being limited to one version of
                itself. What that means is that one object can be shown,
                represented, described in various ways while keeping the same
                meaning. Turned around, it can also mean that one object
                exists as a middle ground of many already existing examples of
                it.

                digital world has become an integral part of our lives. It is
                no longer a place that separates people, but, on the contrary,
                a “communal space” as said in the text. Through the Internet,
                it becomes easy to spread one’s art, and therefore, the text
                argues that “the most radical and ‘progressive’ movements of
                the Post-Internet period” are people who don’t identify as
                artists while creating “cultural objects,” or people who are
                not using “easily-accessible distribution networks” and are
                therefore “largely unnoticed.”

                Today, mythology is everywhere and has become part of our

                easily accessible. Anyone can find images of films on the

                reading the book.

                In the context of the text, and in the context of the
                Internet, it means that an “original copy” doesn’t mean much
                if it even exists. The Internet spreads information very
                quickly and is overflowing with information, therefore, people
                can take ideas and create copies of them. It quickly becomes
                hard to determine what is the original, which was the first
                object to be create. It is even more true if people don’t
                reference the original, or at least the one they used as the
                original. That is why the text argues that the “source object
                can no longer be regarded as inherently greater than any of
                its copes,” because we can hardly ever know which one is the
                original to begin with. Another argument is that even if the
                original is found, if the “copies” are made using a different
                method or medium, how can they be compared? The example of the
                text is creating a sculpture by using a video as the original.
                Even if the theme and story of the video is conveyed in the
                sculpture, they will still be different, and neither can be
                “inherently greater” than the other.

            <p>
              In terms of artistic value, I agree with the text, neither is
              greater because of their status as a “source object” or a
              “copy.” I believe that this is determined by the work itself and
              its execution. Just because it was the original does not mean
              that it is necessarily good and same goes for a copy. However, I
              disagree with the idea that the original is not greater than its
              copies on another level. The copies use the “source object” as
              inspiration and/or a reference; therefore, the copy takes ideas
              from somewhere else, and these ideas are important. That is why
              I think that, although it is true that original cannot be
              considered better or worse than copies from the get-go, it is
              still important to acknowledge when a work is original and when
              a work uses something else as a reference.
