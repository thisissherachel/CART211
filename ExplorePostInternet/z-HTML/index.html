                The meaning of this quote in The Image Object Post-Internet is
                described as an object not being limited to one version of
                itself. What that means is that one object can be shown,
                represented, described in various ways while keeping the same
                meaning. Turned around, it can also mean that one object exists
                as a middle ground of many already existing examples of it.

                In the context of the text, and in the context of the Internet,
                it means that an “original copy” doesn’t mean much. The Internet
                spreads information quickly and is overflowing with information,
                therefore, people can take ideas and create copies. It quickly
                becomes hard to determine what is original and what was copied.
                It is even more true if people don’t reference their source of
                inspiration. That is why the text argues that the “source object
                can no longer be regarded as inherently greater than any of its
                copies,” because we can hardly ever know which one is the
                original to begin with. Another argument is that even if the
                original is found, if the “copies” are made using a different
                method or medium, how can they be compared?

                In terms of artistic value, I agree with the text, neither is
                greater depending on their status as a “source object” or a
                “copy.” I believe that this is determined by the work itself and
                its execution. Just because it was the original does not mean
                that it is necessarily good and same goes for a copy. However, I
                disagree with the idea that the original is not greater than its
                copies on another level. The copies use the “source object” as
                inspiration and/or a reference; therefore, the copy takes ideas
                from somewhere else, and these ideas are important. That is why
                I think that, although it is true that original cannot be
                considered better or worse than copies from the get-go, it is
                still important to acknowledge when a work is original and when
                a work uses something else as a reference.
