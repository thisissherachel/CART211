          <h3>
            In the context of the text, and in the context of the Internet, an
            “original copy” doesn’t mean much. If it even exists. The Internet
            spreads information quicky and widely. People being exposed to some
            much don’t always have access or care to find out where the source
            of an online object is, if it has an original copy, or its date of
            creation. This facilitates ideas being repurposed, recreated, or
            identical copies being created with little detection and no credit
            to the inspiration or source to the original. When the text argues
            that the “source object can no longer be regarded as inherently
            greater than any of its copies” it continues to say that yes on the
            internet we know a source object exists, a source idea exists, but
            its necessity and importance have very little connection to the
            copy. Another argument is that even if the original is found, if the
            “copies” are made using a different method or medium, how can they
            be compared? The example of the text is creating a sculpture by
            using a video as the original. Even if the theme and story of the
            video is conveyed in the sculpture, they will still be different,
            and neither can be “inherently greater” than the other.
          </h3>
          <!-- our take/understanding of it -->
          <p>
            In terms of artistic value, I agree with the text, neither is
            greater because of their status as a “source object” or a “copy.” I
            believe that this is determined by the work itself and its
            execution. Just because it was the original does not mean that it is
            necessarily good and same goes for a copy. However, I disagree with
            the idea that the original is not greater than its copies on another
            level. The copies use the “source object” as inspiration and/or a
            reference; therefore, the copy takes ideas from somewhere else, and
            these ideas are important. That is why I think that, although it is
            true that original cannot be considered better or worse than copies
            from the get-go, it is still important to acknowledge when a work is
            original and when a work uses something else as a reference.
