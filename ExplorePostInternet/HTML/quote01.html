          Something close to the concept around this quote is René Magritte’s
          famous piece called The Treachery of Images where the words “ceci
          n’est pas une pipe” are displayed under the image of a pipe. This
          expressing the idea that something isn’t something if it is only the
          image of something. In this Post-Internet period, that concept is
          almost eradicated. We seem to be in this in between state of the
          physical and the non-physical. So much art is online and can’t
          always be necessarily represented in it’s physical form and, if it
          was, it would almost be an entirely different piece within itself.
          The non-physical state for art objects is so vast, and increasing
          everyday with its contents, reiterations, and possibilities that the
          boundaries of what is what and what takes ore of a form, value, or
          weight over another.
