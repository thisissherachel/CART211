          In Vierkant’s works, this was said to be the goal for either “an
          intention of universality, or created with a deliberate irreverence
          for either venue of transmission.” They precede this with the
          comment that today’s generation is very image based and that
          communication through imagery is what reaches the largest audiences
          and has the best responses. Continuing to say that using language to
          explain a visual artwork can be complicated and sometimes
          inadequate. “Dealing with language can too forcibly illustrate the
          thoughts behind an image or belittle a work if the text is not as
          clever or aesthetic as the image itself.” Therefore, how a physical
          visual work like a painting or a sculpture (or anything analog) is
          transposed to a digital format is important in order to present the
          artwork in a still interesting and relevant way.
        </h3>
        <!-- our take/understanding of it -->
        <p>
          An “intention of universality” and “deliberate irreverence for
          either venue of transmission” makes a lot of sense because the
          ultimate goal for anything today should be universality,
          inclusivity, and adaptability. Especially today when there is so
          much technology allowing for such. This allows for the largest
          audience, the larger individuals being stimulated and inspired, and
          the more creativity. Allowing for universality, inclusivity, and
          adaptability also allows for facilitated sharing and citing of
          works. Which all in all is something that doesn’t ever hurt to have.
