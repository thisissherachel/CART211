        <h3>
          In the context of the text, and in the context of the Internet, an
          “original copy” doesn’t mean much. If it even exists. The Internet
          spreads information quicky and widely. People being exposed to some
          much don’t always have access or care to find out where the source
          of an online object is, if it has an original copy, or its date of
          creation. This facilitates ideas being repurposed, recreated, or
          identical copies being created with little detection and no credit
          to the inspiration or source to the original. When the text argues
          that the “source object can no longer be regarded as inherently
          greater than any of its copies” it continues to say that yes on the
          internet we know a source object exists, a source idea exists, but
          its necessity and importance have very little connection to the
          copy. Another argument is that even if the original is found, if the
          “copies” are made using a different method or medium, how can they
          be compared? The example of the text is creating a sculpture by
          using a video as the original. Even if the theme and story of the
          video is conveyed in the sculpture, they will still be different,
          and neither can be “inherently greater” than the other.
        </h3>
        <!-- our take/understanding of it -->
        <p>
          In terms of artistic value, it does seem reasonable to take the
          stance that in this Post-Internet period an object having that
          status of a “source object” or a “copy” has no effect of one being
          greater than the other. However, the work itself and its execution
          can still be tied to them and have an effect on that value. Just
          because one is the original does not mean that it is necessarily
          good or of value and same goes for a copy. That said, there is still
          something important to say about tracing ideas or inspiration and
          with that the importance of such original copies allowing for that
          inspiration at times. It is true that in today’s ever stimulating
          world, it is difficult to say where original ideas originate and if
          they even exist to a degree. However, one’s acknowledgement for this
          limbo between what is an original source should to not deter one
          from doing their best to give credit to work that influenced them.
          It is easy to dismiss the work that goes into creating art,
          especially with the Post-Internet period where the physical form is
          less depended upon however, that work and creativity, should still
          be held to artists.
