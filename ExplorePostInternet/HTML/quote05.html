          <h3>
            Vierkant mentions this in relation to the idea that today, mythology
            is everywhere and has become part of our everyday life. We see
            mythology with superheroes in films and books. They have become part
            of our everyday life and they are easily accessible. Anyone can find
            images of films on the Internet or know of a story without seeing
            the movie or reading the book.
          </h3>
          <!-- our take/understanding of it -->
          <p>
            This idea of the unimaginable now being imaginable due to the power
            of the internet is quite intriguing because again, it is another
            cultural aspect that changed through time and the evolution of
            technology. The saying “imagine the impossible” could now be “create
            the impossible”. The internet gives us enormous amounts of freedom
            and through creativity that is especially true. Vierkant expresses
            that through the over saturation and fiction movies and media and
            that just goes to show the direction we are heading. An enormous
            amount of media representation of fiction and pure imagination of
            the impossible.
