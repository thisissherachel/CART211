          “The use of “We” is not to advocate solely for participatory
          structures of art but to insist on a participatory view of culture
          at large, and ultimately of taking iconoclasm itself as a quotidian
          activity.”

        <h3>
          This is said regarding the aspect of observing art and the common
          occurrence of a viewers making dissatisfactory comments in which
          insinuates that to satisfy the viewer, the artist should be the one
          doing the changes or the work to do so. Vierkant argues that
          <br />
          “‘They’ venerates this absoluteness, sanctifies it, while its
          opposite, ‘We,’ postures towards the creation of an alternative and
          constitutes an actual schism”
          <br />
          and so one should take that criticism and use that as inspiration to
          accomplish that themselves. Given the art and methods to accomplish
          it are so accessible through the internet today, why not do it
          yourself. This thus furthering this idea of the Post-Internet period
          where original copies and copies are rampant. Why not take advantage
          of that to bind this relationship between the artist and the viewer.
          Vierkant continues to summarize this beautifully with:
          <br />
          “These are conditions endemic to Post-Internet society, allowing for
          a ubiquitous authorship which challenges notions of the ‘definitive
          history’ or the ‘original copy.’ Just as Barthes' proclamation of
          the ‘death of the author’ is in fact a celebration of the ‘birth of
          the reader’ and the ‘overthrow[ing of] the myth,’ culture
          Post-Internet is made up of reader-authors who by necessity must
          regard all cultural output as an idea or work in progress able to be
          taken up and continued by any of its viewers”
        </h3>
        <!-- our take/understanding of it -->
        <p>
          There was a mention of this idea that only the artist/author or the
          higher members in society were the ones able to act on criticism and
          thus this segregation between the author and the viewer arose and
          how that is not the case anymore. Given internet, our access to
          skills, information, and the ability to make changes has most
          definitely increased our ability to take things into our hands. This
          idea of a stronger concept of “We” to allow for more of community
          engagement is enticing. I believe as an artist one of the most
          interesting things is seeing works impact your art can have. One
          could even go to say that art in its truest form is to satisfy you
          inner self and not for the purpose of pleasing a crowd. Artists
          benefit from having a viewership yes, but when criticism is taken
          and something is creature for the sole purpose of pleasing the
          viewer, it has a different feel to it. Criticizing an artist’s
          decision making brings you no where because it was not made to
          please you.
